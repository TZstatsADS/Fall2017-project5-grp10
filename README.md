+ Projec title: Wine Quanlity Prediction
+ Team members
	+ team member Yina Wei
	+ team member Jiayu Ni
+ Project summary: We implemented four methods to make prediction for the wine quality: linear regression, LASSO, neural network, Random forest. We adopted 12 varibales to make the prediction and used MSE as performance matrix. After model evulation and comparison, we found out that the result for the random forest is the best.
	
**Contribution statement**: 
Yina Wei:
+ Gathered data from several large dataset and processed the data
+ Bulit linear regression, neural network, random forest models to make prediction
+ Comparison of the models result
+ Created a ppt for presentation and present to class

Jiayu Ni:
Data processiong and draw plots
Built Lasso model
