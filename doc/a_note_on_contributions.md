Summary: In this project, we developed four methods to make prediction for the wine quality: Linear regression, neural network, lasso and random forest. We did data preprocession to fit the moedel and calculated the MSE for each model. After comparison, we found that the random forest model performs best according to the prediction accuracy.

Yina Wei:
+ Gathered data from several large dataset and processed the data
+ Bulit linear regression, neural network, random forest models to make prediction
+ Comparison of the models result
+ Created a ppt for presentation and present to class

Jiayu Ni:
Data processiong and draw plots
Built Lasso model
